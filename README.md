### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

My name is Anna, and I am originally from Russia. After relocating to the UK in 2021, I started learning to code on my own by using various free online resources, including Microsoft, Codecademy, Code First Girls, Moo ICT, Khan Academy, and GitHub.
Towards the end of 2022, I completed a 12 week Full-Stack Development bootcamp at [_nology](https://nology.io/). Beginning 2023, I joined [Phlo Systems](https://www.phlo.io/) as an unpaid intern. In June of that year, I was hired by Phlo Systems as a Junior Software Engineer.

I initially worked on a React front-end for a commodity hedging platform. Later, I moved to another team where I worked on a full-stack Node.JS application for automating customs declarations to the UK tax authority. Most recently, I have been helping to rewrite this application
using .NET and Angular with ABP Framework. Throughout this time, I have continued to hone my skills and learn on the job, and I have completed several more online courses from Dometrain.
